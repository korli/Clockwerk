Clockwerk
=========
Clockwerk is an Open Source media compositing tool for the Haiku platform.
It has been in development from Jan 2006 to July 2008 by Mindwork (www.mindwork.de) as one of the main in-house components of an application suit to realize distributed multimedia playback on Haiku client machines.

Clockwerk was used to create playback content and schedules and could upload these to Java based servers.

To compile on Haiku:

jam


To start Clockwerk:

./generated/distro-haiku/Clockwerk


A short tutorial:

Start by invoking "Playlist -> New"

This opens the new playlist. Drag media clips from Tracker into the clip list view. From there, drag them into the track view to create clip instances. Clips may also be virtual. Use the Clip menu to create virtual clips, for example text objects.
