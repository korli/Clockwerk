The build system has only been tested on Haiku. To build all Clockwerk
components, run the command "jam" followed by "jam fulldistro" at the root
folder. This will create a subfolder "distro-haiku-with-libs" inside the
"generated" folder. If you accidentally run Clockwerk-Player, type Cmd-Q to
exit it. The player does not do anything useful in it's current state, since
it is missing other software components which used to be part of the Mindwork
software suit.

Have fun!
