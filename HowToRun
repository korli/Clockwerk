TODO: This file contains outdated information that applies to components
which have been stripped from the Open Source version! The main component of
the Open Source version is Clockwerk, the editor. And this one can be launched
like any regular BeOS/Haiku application.
It is currently not possible to save project data outside of the
"/boot/home/clockwerk" folder. Every created or imported clip will be copied
into this folder. To save the current objects including the current playlist,
invoke "Playlist->Save Objects". Clockwerk will always load the object library
on start and open the last used playlist.
---

Settings:

* All settings files go into ~/config/settings/mindwork-m3. Examples for
  each settings file are to be found in the source subfolder for the
  respective component.

* Most important are the XML settings files named clockwerk_settings.

* The Player uses file logging if the file

  ~/config/settings/mindwork-m3/player_log_path

  exists, and the path to the logfile is supposed to be
  the only contents of this file.

* The Player can also use an alternative logging framework with more
  fine grained options configured in

  ~/config/settings/mindwork-m3/player-log.properties
  
Notes:

* For the Player to do anything, the Controller needs to be
  running. The Player does not load objects by default, and does
  not play a schedule by itself. If the Controller dies while
  the Player is already playing, the playback continues uninterrupted.
  A mechanism in the protocol between Controller and Player avoids
  unintended updates when new instance of the Controller starts while
  the Player is already playing. This is implemented via the file
  "update-status" in the Clockwerk-XX folder where the Controller maintains
  persistent synchronization status information. For example, the controller
  knows wether an update was successful. Only successful updates trigger
  a reload of the objects in the player!

* Holding down the shift key while the Player is launching will
  make it run in window mode. The same effect is achieved by
  passing -t when launching it from the command line.

* A running Player can be quit by pressing Command-Q, pressing
  Command-H will hide the window. Command-F will toggle fullscreen
  and window mode.
